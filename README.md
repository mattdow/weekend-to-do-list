# Weekend Challenge 3: To-Do App

## Description

This application is a to-do task manager with the following functionality:

-Tasks can be stored and displayed with the following information: task name, priority, due date, completion status, and an optional context tag for sorting.
-Any active tasks will be entered into the database displayed on the front-end, sorted first by completion, then by priority, then by due date.
-Users can enter a new task using the form and submit button. Tasks will then be re-rendered.
-Users can click a button to mark the task complete, which will change the background color, hide the button, and show a completed message.
-Users can delete any task. Clicking a delete task will show a modal allowing them to confirm the delete.
-Users can also click on the table headers for priority, due date, and context tag, which calls on the server/database to resort the tasks specifically by that category.

This application requires the JENS stack (Javascript, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL). Additionally, formatting, styling, and the modal were developed using Bootstrap.
